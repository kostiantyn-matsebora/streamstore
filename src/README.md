# StreamStore

A lightweight library provides a logical layer for storing and querying events as a stream.

Heavily inspired by Greg Young's Event Store and [`Streamstone`](https://github.com/yevhen/Streamstone) solutions.

## Overview

The library itself does not provide any production-ready database storage implementation _yet_, but it is designed to be easily extended with custom database backends.

`In-memory` database implementation is provided **for testing and educational purposes only**.

More information you can find in the [documentation](https://github.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/streamstore).

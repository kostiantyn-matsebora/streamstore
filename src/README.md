# StreamStore

A lightweight library provides a logical layer for storing and querying events as a stream.

Heavily inspired by Greg Young's Event Store and [`Streamstone`](https://github.com/yevhen/Streamstone) solutions.

More information you can find in the [documentation](https://github.com/kostiantyn-matsebora/streamstore).
